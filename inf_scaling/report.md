# LLM 的复杂推理：Scaling Inference Compute of Long Reasoning Models with Small Proxies

## Implementation

This project implements a method for scaling inference compute of long reasoning LLMs with small proxy models, aiming to achieve high performance with constrained computational costs. 

### Task Formulation

The goal of the task is to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer multiple-choice questions through *chain-of-thought reasoning*. Formally, given an input query $ Q $ and a set of candidate answers $ \{ A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \} $, the model is required to output a choice $ A_i \in \{ A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \} $ that is most likely to be correct, based on the reasoning process $ R(Q) $ generated from $ Q $.

Here, $ R(Q) $ represents the reasoning chain derived from the query $ Q $, which provides the logical steps leading to a conclusion. The model then selects the answer $ A_i $ based on $ R(Q) $ implicitly. So the task can be formally expressed as:

$$
\hat{A} = \arg \max_{A_i \in \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}} P_\theta(A_i, R(Q) | Q),
$$

where $ \hat{A} $ is the predicted answer and $\theta$ denotes the LLM. This formulation assumes that the reasoning process $ R(Q) $ acts as an intermediary that transforms the input query $ Q $ into a coherent reasoning chain, which in turn determines the optimal answer choice $ A_i $.

### LLM Selection

For experimentation, the project selects two series of LLMs, including large reasoning models and smaller LLMs which have less than 10B parameters.

- **Large Reasoning Models (LRMs):**
    - **QwQ-32B-Preview**: A 32B-parameter model trained with long-term reasoning oriented objectives. It has shown superior performance on the GPQA benchmark.

- **Small LLMs:**
    - **LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct**: A 8B-parameter model, representing cutting-edge performance of the LLaMA series.
    - **ChatGLM3-6b**: A 6B-parameter model with bilingual capabilities (English and Chinese).

### Methodology

The project explores main methods for scaling inference compute of long reasoning models. Based on the well-used methods, the project further designs a method that combines the advantages of effectiveness in long reasoning models and the efficiency of small proxies.

#### Preliminaries

1. **Pass@N**: The method samples $ N $ results at each query from an LLM, and for each query, the value is 1 if the correct answer is included in the $ N $ results, and 0 otherwise. The final score is the average of the values over all queries. Specifically, in this project, results of this method is calculated with expected value, and the derivation is shown as follows:
    $$
    \boxed{
    E[\text{PassN}]
    = 1 \;-\; \frac{\binom{M - T}{N}}{\binom{M}{N}},
    }
    $$
    where $ M (> N) $ is the total number of sampled responses, and $ T $ is the number of correct responses.

2. **Maj@N**: The method samples $ N $ results at each query from an LLM, and for each query, the value is 1 if the majority of the $ N $ results contain the correct answer, and 0 otherwise. The final score is the average of the values over all queries. Specifically, the results of this method is calculated in expected values as well, based on $10^3$ times Monte Carlo sampling. The formulation is as follows:
    $$
    \boxed{
    E[\text{MajN}] = \frac{1}{\binom{M}{N}} \sum_{S \subseteq \{R_1, \dots, R_M\}, |S| = N} \arg \max_{A_i \in \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}} \sum_{R \in S} \mathbf{1}_{\{\hat{A}_{R} = A_i\}},
    }
    $$
    Where $ R_i $ is the $ i $-th response, $ A_i $ is the $ i $-th choice, and $ \hat{A}_{R} $ is the predicted answer of response $ R $. 
    Core codes are as follows:
    ```python
    majn_sum = 0.0
    total_subsets = 0
    
    for subset in itertools.combinations(range(M), N):
        sub_choice_list = [choice_list[i] for i in subset]
        weighted_counter = Counter()
        for i in range(N):
            if sub_choice_list[i] is not None:
                weighted_counter[sub_choice_list[i]] += weights[subset[i]]
        
        max_count = max(weighted_counter.values()) if weighted_counter else 0
        most_frequent_choices = [choice for choice, count in weighted_counter.items() if count == max_count]
        
        if correct_choice in most_frequent_choices:
            if len(most_frequent_choices) == 1:
                contrib = 1.0
            else:
                contrib = 1.0 / len(most_frequent_choices)
        else:
            contrib = 0.0
        majn_sum += contrib
        total_subsets += 1
    # Result
    if total_subsets == 0:
        expected_majn = 0.0
    expected_majn = majn_sum / total_subsets
    ```

#### Better Inference Compute Scaling of LRMs

To step beyond mere majority voting, the project proposes a method that combines the advantages of long reasoning models and small proxy models. 

![method](./method.png)

Upon the figure, the left part (a) represents rolling out LRMs to generate reasoning chains, and then generate self-confidence labels to perform weighted majority voting. The approach of weighted majority voting is to assign weights to each response based on the confidence labels, and then select the answer with the highest weighted count, whose formulation is as follows:
$$
\boxed{
E[\text{WeightedMajN}] = \frac{1}{\binom{M}{N}} \sum_{S \subseteq \{R_1, \dots, R_M\}, |S| = N} \arg \max_{A_i \in \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}} \sum_{R \in S} \mathbf{1}_{\{\hat{A}_{R} = A_i\}} \cdot \text{Conf}_R,
}
$$
where $ \text{Conf}_R $ is the confidence label of response $ R $. Specifically, the confidence labels can be mapped into any range $[0.5-\epsilon, 0.5+\epsilon]$ with length $2\epsilon$.

As a special case, `BestConf@N` selects the response with the highest confidence label, represented as:
$$
\boxed{
E[\text{BestConfN}] = \frac{1}{\binom{M}{N}} \sum_{S \subseteq \{R_1, \dots, R_M\}, |S| = N} \arg \max_{A_i \in \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}} \mathbf{1}_{\{\hat{A}_{R} = A_i\}} \cdot \text{Conf}_R.
}
$$

In the figure above, the right part (b) represents the method of using small proxies to generate reasoning chains, and then use the LRM to generate confidence labels, aiming to combine the effectiveness of LRMs and the efficiency of small proxies.

Also, the results of these methods are calculated in expected values based on $10^3$ times Monte Carlo sampling.

### Cases

- **Case 1:** from QwQ-32B-Preview (Self-Confidence)
    - **Question:** A coating is applied to a substrate resulting in a perfectly smooth surface. The measured contact angles of this smooth coating are 132° and 102° for water and hexadecane respectively. The coating formulation is then modified and when now applied to the same type of substrate, a rough surface is produced. When a droplet of water or oil sits on the rough surface, the wettability of the surface can now be described by the Cassie-Baxter state. The water contact angle on the rough surface is now 148°. What would be the best estimate of the contact angle of a droplet of octane on the rough surface? 
    - **Choices:** ["129°", "139°", "124°", "134°"]
    - **Response:** So I've got this problem here about contact angles and surface roughness. Let's see what it's asking.

        First, there's a coating applied to a substrate that makes a perfectly smooth surface. They measure the contact angles for water and hexadecane on this smooth surface, and they get 132° and 102° respectively. Then, they modify the coating formulation, and when applied again to the same substrate, it produces a rough surface. On this rough surface, the contact angle for water is now 148°, and it's in the Cassie-Baxter state. The question is asking for the best estimate of the contact angle of a droplet of octane on this rough surface, and gives four options: 129°, 139°, 124°, or 134°.

        Okay, so I need to relate the contact angles on the smooth and rough surfaces for different liquids. Let's recall some concepts about contact angles and surface roughness.

        I know that for a smooth surface, the contact angle is determined by the interface energies between the liquid, solid, and air, as described by the Young's equation:

        cos θ = (γsv - γsl) / γlv

        where θ is the contact angle, γsv is the solid-vapor interfacial tension, γsl is the solid-liquid interfacial tension, and γlv is the liquid-vapor interfacial tension.

        But here, the surface is rough, and it's described by the Cassie-Baxter equation, which accounts for the roughness and possibly the presence of air pockets in the texture.

        The Cassie-Baxter equation is:

        cos θ_cb = f cos θ_y + (f - 1)

        where θ_cb is the contact angle in the Cassie-Baxter state, θ_y is the Young's contact angle (for the smooth surface), and f is the fraction of the solid surface in contact with the liquid.

        Wait, actually, I think I have that formula a bit mixed up. Let me look it up.

        Upon checking, the Cassie-Baxter equation is:

        cos θ_cb = f cos θ_y - (1 - f)

        where θ_cb is the apparent contact angle on the rough surface, θ_y is the Young's contact angle on the smooth surface, and f is the fraction of the solid surface in contact with the liquid.

        Given that, I can relate the contact angles on the smooth and rough surfaces for water.

        Given:

        - Smooth surface water contact angle (θ_y-water) = 132°

        - Rough surface water contact angle (θ_cb-water) = 148°

        I can plug these into the Cassie-Baxter equation to solve for f.

        So:

        cos(148°) = f cos(132°) - (1 - f)

        Let's calculate the cosines:

        cos(148°) = -0.8480

        cos(132°) = -0.6691

        So:

        -0.8480 = f*(-0.6691) - (1 - f)

        Let's solve for f:

        -0.8480 = -0.6691f - 1 + f

        Combine like terms:

        -0.8480 + 1 = f - 0.6691f

        0.1520 = 0.3309f

        f = 0.1520 / 0.3309 ≈ 0.4595

        So, f is approximately 0.4595.

        Now, I need to find the contact angle of octane on the rough surface. But I don't have the contact angle of octane on the smooth surface. I only have data for water and hexadecane on the smooth surface.

        Wait, the smooth surface contact angles are given for water (132°) and hexadecane (102°). But not for octane.

        Hmm, so I need to find a way to estimate the contact angle of octane on the smooth surface first, and then use the Cassie-Baxter equation with the f value I just calculated to find the contact angle on the rough surface.

        How can I estimate the contact angle of octane on the smooth surface?

        Maybe I can look up the surface tensions of water, hexadecane, and octane, and see if there's a relationship.

        Let's recall that the contact angle is related to the interfacial tensions via Young's equation:

        cos θ = (γsv - γsl) / γlv

        For a given solid, γsv is constant, and γlv depends on the liquid.

        So, if I have contact angles for water and hexadecane, maybe I can set up equations to solve for γsl and then use that to find the contact angle for octane.

        Let's try that.

        First, for water:

        cos θ_water = (γsv - γsl) / γlv_water

        Similarly, for hexadecane:

        cos θ_hex = (γsv - γsl) / γlv_hex

        I can solve these two equations for γsv and γsl.

        Let's denote:

        cos θ_water = a

        cos θ_hex = b

        γlv_water = c

        γlv_hex = d

        Then:

        a = (γsv - γsl) / c

        b = (γsv - γsl) / d

        From the first equation:

        γsv - γsl = a*c

        From the second equation:

        γsv - γsl = b*d

        So, a*c = b*d

        Wait, that seems off. If both expressions equal γsv - γsl, then they should be equal to each other.

        But that would just give me a*c = b*d, which doesn't help me find γsv or γsl individually.

        Maybe I need another approach.

        Perhaps I can assume that the solid-liquid interfacial tension (γsl) changes with different liquids, but I don't have enough information to determine that.

        Alternatively, maybe I can look up the surface tensions of water, hexadecane, and octane, and assume that the solid-vapor interfacial tension (γsv) is constant, and try to find a relationship.

        Let's look up the surface tensions:

        Water at 20°C: γlv ≈ 72.8 mN/m

        Hexadecane at 20°C: γlv ≈ 27.5 mN/m

        Octane at 20°C: γlv ≈ 21.8 mN/m

        Now, using Young's equation for water and hexadecane:

        For water:

        cos 132° = (γsv - γsl_water) / 72.8

        cos 132° ≈ -0.6691

        So:

        -0.6691 = (γsv - γsl_water) / 72.8

        Similarly for hexadecane:

        cos 102° = (γsv - γsl_hex) / 27.5

        cos 102° ≈ -0.2079

        So:

        -0.2079 = (γsv - γsl_hex) / 27.5

        Now, I have two equations:

        1) γsv - γsl_water = -0.6691 * 72.8 ≈ -48.61 mN/m

        2) γsv - γsl_hex = -0.2079 * 27.5 ≈ -5.71 mN/m

        Now, I need to relate γsl_water and γsl_hex.

        Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the solid is similar for both cases, so γsv is the same in both equations.

        Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

        (γsv - γsl_water) - (γsv - γsl_hex) = -48.61 - (-5.71)

        Simplify:

        - γsl_water + γsl_hex = -42.90 mN/m

        So:

        γsl_hex - γsl_water = -42.90 mN/m

        Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

        Maybe I need to consider the difference in γsl between water and hexadecane.

        Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the solid is similar for both, and try to find a ratio or something.

        This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

        Let me think differently. Maybe I can use the concept of similar liquids having similar contact angles, or use the interfacial tensions to estimate the contact angle for octane.

        Given that I have γlv for water, hexadecane, and octane, and I have contact angles for water and hexadecane, perhaps I can assume that the solid-liquid interfacial tension (γsl) changes in a similar way between hexadecane and octane, since they are both alkanes.

        Octane is C8H18, and hexadecane is C16H34, so they are similar in nature.

        Maybe I can assume that the solid-liquid interfacial tension for octane (γsl_oct) is intermediate between that of water and hexadecane, or perhaps proportional to the liquid-vapor surface tension.

        But that seems too vague.

        Alternatively, maybe I can use the Owens-Wendt theory to estimate the dispersive and polar components of the interfacial tensions and relate them.

        But that might be too involved for this problem.

        Wait, perhaps I can use the Wu metric or the Zisman plot to estimate the octane contact angle.

        In the Zisman plot, one plots cos θ versus γlv, and extrapolates to find the critical surface tension.

        But I only have two points, which might not be enough.

        Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the contact angle for octane on the smooth surface is intermediate between that of water and hexadecane, based on their surface tensions.

        Water has a higher γlv (72.8 mN/m) and a higher contact angle (132°), while hexadecane has a lower γlv (27.5 mN/m) and a lower contact angle (102°).

        So, octane has γlv = 21.8 mN/m, which is lower than hexadecane, so perhaps its contact angle on the smooth surface would be even lower than hexadecane's 102°.

        But that doesn't make sense, because usually, lower γlv liquids have lower contact angles on hydrophobic surfaces.

        Wait, actually, on hydrophobic surfaces, low γlv liquids can have higher contact angles.

        I'm getting confused.

        Let me recall that on hydrophobic surfaces, water has a high contact angle, while low surface tension liquids like alkane have even higher contact angles.

        Wait, no. Actually, on highly hydrophobic surfaces, water has a high contact angle (nearly 180°), while low surface tension liquids like alkane can also have high contact angles, but perhaps not as high as water.

        Wait, I need to think about this carefully.

        In general, for a given solid, the contact angle depends on the liquid's properties, primarily its surface tension.

        For hydrophobic surfaces, water has a high contact angle, but for low surface tension liquids like alkane, the contact angle can be even higher, approaching 180°.

        So, in this case, since hexadecane has a lower γlv than water and a lower contact angle (102° vs 132°), and octane has an even lower γlv, perhaps its contact angle on the smooth surface would be lower than hexadecane's 102°.

        But that seems counterintuitive, because lower γlv liquids should wet the surface less, leading to higher contact angles on hydrophobic surfaces.

        Wait, maybe I need to consider the polarity as well.

        Water is polar, hexadecane and octane are nonpolar. So, on a nonpolar surface, nonpolar liquids should have lower contact angles than polar liquids.

        Wait, no. On a nonpolar surface, nonpolar liquids should have higher contact angles if the surface is hydrophobic.

        I'm getting more confused.

        Let me look up some general trends.

        Upon checking, for hydrophobic surfaces, water has high contact angles, while low surface tension liquids like alkane can have even higher contact angles.

        So, if the surface is hydrophobic, and water has a contact angle of 132°, hexadecane has 102°, that seems inconsistent with general trends.

        Wait, perhaps in this specific case, the surface has some specific interactions with the liquids.

        Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the contact angle is inversely related to the liquid's surface tension for a given solid.

        But in this case, water has higher γlv and higher contact angle, while hexadecane has lower γlv and lower contact angle, which seems counter to general trends.

        Wait, perhaps there's something else going on here.

        Alternatively, maybe I should accept that for this specific surface, higher γlv liquids have higher contact angles, and try to estimate the contact angle for octane accordingly.

        Given that, since octane has lower γlv than hexadecane, its contact angle on the smooth surface would be lower than hexadecane's 102°.

        But then, when the surface is rough, the contact angle increases due to the air pockets, as described by the Cassie-Baxter equation.

        Wait, but in this case, for water, the contact angle increased from 132° to 148° on the rough surface.

        So, perhaps I can assume that the contact angle for octane on the rough surface would increase by a similar amount.

        But I don't know the contact angle on the smooth surface for octane.

        Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between the contact angles on the smooth and rough surfaces for water, and apply that to octane.

        Given that, for water:

        θ_cb = 148°

        θ_y = 132°

        f = 0.4595 (as calculated earlier)

        Using the Cassie-Baxter equation:

        cos θ_cb = f cos θ_y - (1 - f)

        Plugging in the values:

        cos(148°) = 0.4595 cos(132°) - (1 - 0.4595)

        Which checks out, as I used this to find f.

        Now, if I assume that the same f applies to octane on the rough surface, I can estimate θ_cb for octane if I know θ_y for octane.

        But I don't know θ_y for octane.

        Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the difference between θ_cb and θ_y is similar for water and octane.

        But that seems arbitrary.

        Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the ratio of θ_cb to θ_y is similar for water and octane.

        But again, that's speculative.

        Maybe I need to think differently.

        Let me consider the energy balance in the Cassie-Baxter state.

        The effective contact angle is influenced by the roughness and the air trapped in the texture.

        Perhaps I can consider that the contact angle on the rough surface is a function of the contact angle on the smooth surface and the roughness parameter f.

        Given that, maybe I can express θ_cb in terms of θ_y and f, and then estimate θ_y for octane.

        But I already have the relationship from the Cassie-Baxter equation.

        Alternatively, maybe I can look for a correlation between the surface tensions and the contact angles.

        Let me plot the contact angles against the surface tensions for water and hexadecane and see if there's a linear relationship.

        For water:

        γlv = 72.8 mN/m

        θ_y = 132°

        For hexadecane:

        γlv = 27.5 mN/m

        θ_y = 102°

        If I plot θ_y vs γlv, it's a decreasing relationship: higher γlv corresponds to higher θ_y.

        Wait, no, higher γlv corresponds to higher θ_y in this case, which seems counterintuitive.

        Wait, no, actually, in this specific case, higher γlv corresponds to higher θ_y, meaning that higher surface tension liquids have higher contact angles, which suggests that the surface is hydrophobic.

        In general, for hydrophobic surfaces, water (high γlv) has high contact angles, and low γlv liquids have even higher contact angles.

        But in this case, hexadecane (lower γlv than water) has a lower contact angle than water, which is unusual.

        Maybe there's something specific about this surface.

        Alternatively, perhaps the surface is hydrophobic but has some specific interactions with hexadecane.

        This is confusing.

        Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the contact angle is not directly related to the surface tension in a simple manner, and instead focus on the Cassie-Baxter equation.

        Given that, perhaps I can assume that the roughness effect is similar for different liquids, and estimate the contact angle for octane on the rough surface based on its contact angle on the smooth surface.

        But I still need to estimate θ_y for octane.

        Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Cassie-Baxter equation relates θ_cb to θ_y via f, and since f is a property of the rough surface, it should be the same for different liquids.

        Wait, but f is the fraction of the solid in contact with the liquid, which might depend on the liquid's properties.

        However, for simplicity, maybe I can assume that f is the same for water and octane.

        Given that, I can use the Cassie-Baxter equation for water to find f, which I already did (f ≈ 0.4595), and then use that f to find θ_cb for octane.

        But I still need θ_y for octane.

        Alternatively, maybe I can estimate θ_y for octane based on the known θ_y for water and hexadecane.

        Given that, perhaps I can assume a linear relationship between log(γlv) and θ_y.

        Let's try that.

        Take log of γlv for water and hexadecane:

        log(72.8) ≈ 1.862

        θ_y = 132°

        log(27.5) ≈ 1.439

        θ_y = 102°

        Assume a linear relationship:

        θ_y = m * log(γlv) + b

        Plug in the two points:

        132 = m * 1.862 + b

        102 = m * 1.439 + b

        Subtract the second equation from the first:

        132 - 102 = m*(1.862 - 1.439)

        30 = m*0.423

        m = 30 / 0.423 ≈ 70.92

        Now, plug back to find b:

        132 = 70.92*1.862 + b

        132 = 131.99 + b

        b ≈ 0

        So, the relationship is approximately:

        θ_y ≈ 70.92 * log(γlv)

        Now, for octane, γlv = 21.8 mN/m

        log(21.8) ≈ 1.338

        So, θ_y ≈ 70.92 * 1.338 ≈ 94.7°

        So, estimated θ_y for octane is approximately 94.7° on the smooth surface.

        Now, using the Cassie-Baxter equation for the rough surface:

        cos θ_cb = f cos θ_y - (1 - f)

        Where f ≈ 0.4595, θ_y ≈ 94.7°

        Calculate cos θ_y:

        cos(94.7°) ≈ -0.076

        So,

        cos θ_cb = 0.4595*(-0.076) - (1 - 0.4595) ≈ -0.035 - 0.5405 ≈ -0.5755

        Now, find θ_cb:

        θ_cb = arccos(-0.5755) ≈ 125.1°

        So, the estimated contact angle for octane on the rough surface is approximately 125.1°.

        Looking at the options:

        (A) 129°

        (B) 139°

        (C) 124°

        (D) 134°

        The closest option to 125.1° is (C) 124°.

        Therefore, the best estimate is (C) 124°.

        **Final Answer**

        $$ \boxed{C} $$

    - **Confidence:** 0.8
    - **Correctness:** True

- **Case 2:** from QwQ-32B-Preview (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct)
    - **Question:** A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition $0.5|\uparrow\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\downarrow\rangle$ of its spin-up and spin-down states. If $|\uparrow\rangle and |\downarrow\rangle$ are the eigenstates of $\sigma{z}$ , then what is the expectation value up to one decimal place, of the operator $10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}$ ? Here, symbols have their usual meanings
    - **Choices:** ["-0.7", "-1.4", "0.85", "1.65"]
    - **Response:** To find the expectation value of the operator 10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}, we need to follow these steps:

        1. Find the matrix representation of the given states $|\uparrow\rangle$ and $|\downarrow\rangle$.
        2. Find the matrix representation of the operators $\sigma{z}$ and $\sigma_{x}$.
        3. Find the expectation value of the operator $10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}$.

        Step 1:
        The eigenstates of $\sigma{z}$ are $|\uparrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $|\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

        Step 2:
        The matrix representation of $\sigma{z}$ is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ and the matrix representation of $\sigma_{x} is \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

        Step 3:
        The given state is a linear superposition of the eigenstates of $\sigma{z}$:
        $$|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle+sqrt(3)/2|\downarrow\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ sqrt(3)/2 \end{pmatrix}.$$

        To find the expectation value of the operator $10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}$, we need to find the matrix representation of this operator:
        $$10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x} = 10\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} + 5\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 & 5 \\ 5 & -10 \end{pmatrix}.$$

        Now, we can find the expectation value of the operator $10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}$:
        $$\langle\psi|(10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x})|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & sqrt(3)/2 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 5 \\ 5 & -10 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ sqrt(3)/2 \end{pmatrix}.$$
        Expanding the matrix multiplication gives:
        $$\langle\psi|(10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x})|\psi\rangle = (0.5)(10)(0.5) + (0.5)(5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(5)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-10)(sqrt(3)/2)$$
        $$= 2.5 + 1.125 + 1.125 - 7.5$$
        $$= -3.75.$$

        However, we need to find the expectation value up to one decimal place. But we are given the option to choose from the answer choices which are all positive. So we must have made a mistake in calculating the expectation value. Let's recheck the calculation.

        Expanding the matrix multiplication gives:
        $$\langle\psi|(10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x})|\psi\rangle = (0.5)(10)(0.5) + (0.5)(5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(5)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-10)(sqrt(3)/2)$$
        $$= 2.5 + (5*sqrt(3))/4 + (5*sqrt(3))/4 - 7.5$$
        $$= 2.5 + 5*sqrt(3)/2 - 7.5$$
        $$= 2.5 - 7.5 + 5*sqrt(3)/2$$
        $$= -5 + 5*sqrt(3)/2$$

        Now, we can simplify the expression:
        $$-5 + 5*sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67 ≈ -0.7$$

        So, the expectation value up to one decimal place of the operator $10\sigma{z}+5\sigma_{x}$ is -0.7.

        The final answer is [[A]].
    
    - **Confidence:** 0.9
    - **Correctness:** True

- **Case 3:** from QwQ-32B-Preview (ChatGLM3-6b)
    - **Question:** We would like to dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?
    - **Choices:** ["pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3", "pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3", "pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3", "pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3"]
    - **Response:** To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

        Step 1: Find the amount of Fe(OH)3 needed to dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm3 of water.

        We know that Fe(OH)3 has a solubility of 0.0002 g/cm3 at 25°C. So, the amount of Fe(OH)3 needed to dissolve 0.1 g is:

        Amount of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 0.0002 g/cm3 = 50 cm3

        Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the strong acid needed to prepare the solution.

        Since we want to prepare a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, the concentration of the strong acid should be 0.1 M. Therefore, the minimum volume of the strong acid needed is:

        Minimum volume of strong acid = (Concentration of strong acid * Volume of Fe(OH)3) / (Concentration of monobasic acid)

        Assuming the concentration of monobasic acid is 1 M (since it is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid), the minimum volume of the strong acid needed is:

        Minimum volume of strong acid = (0.1 M * 50 cm3) / 1 M = 5 cm3

        Therefore, the minimum volume of the strong acid needed is 5 cm3.

        Step 3: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution.

        To calculate the pH of the resulting solution, we need to understand that the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. Since we are using a strong acid, all of the acid will dissolve in the solution, resulting in a high concentration of H+ ions.

        The pH of a solution is calculated using the following equation:

        pH = - log [H+]

        where [H+] is the concentration of H+ ions in the solution.

        Since we are using a strong acid, the concentration of H+ ions in the solution is equal to the concentration of the strong acid. Therefore, the pH of the resulting solution is:

        pH = - log (Concentration of strong acid)

        Substituting the value we found in Step 2, we get:

        pH = - log (0.1 M) = -0.301

        Therefore, the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.70.

        Step 4: Choose the correct answer.

        Based on our calculations, the correct answer is:

        [[C]] (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3)

### Discussions

- **Effectiveness of Inference Compute Scaling on LRMs:**

    The experimental results demonstrate that scaling inference compute on LRMs significantly enhances their performance on the GPQA benchmark. Specifically, the `Pass@N` method exhibits a substantial increase in accuracy as the number of samples $ N $ grows. 
    For practical usages, the `Maj@N` method, which relies on majority voting, shows improvement across different values of $ N $. However, the gap against `Pass@N` indicating that simple majority voting does not fully exploit the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. When incorporating confidence labels through `WeightedMaj@N`, there is a noticeable enhancement in performance, suggesting that weighting responses based on their confidence can better capture the reliability of each reasoning chain.

    These findings highlight that while scaling inference compute using methods like `Maj@N` can improve LRM performance, integrating confidence-based strategies further refines the selection of correct answers, making the inference process more robust and reliable.

- **Efficiency of Small Proxies:**

    Small proxy models, such as LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and ChatGLM3-6b, play a crucial role in enhancing computational efficiency without significantly compromising performance. These models, with fewer parameters and lower computational demands, are adept at generating initial reasoning chains rapidly. 

    Moreover, the integration of small proxies with LRMs, as seen in methods like `QwQ-32B-Preview (ChatGLM3-6b) w/ BestConf@N`, strikes a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming `ChatGLM3-6b w/ Maj@N`. By utilizing small proxies to generate reasoning chains and then employing the LRM to assign confidence labels, the system benefits from the rapid generation capabilities of smaller models and the robust reasoning prowess of larger models. This hybrid approach not only reduces overall computational costs but also maintains a competitive accuracy level, making it a viable strategy for large-scale deployments where resource optimization is paramount.

    From the trends shown in the empirical results, it might be evident that smaller the proxy model is, better the performance improvement is.

- **Comparison with Reward Model Guided Sampling:**

    Reward model (RM) guided sampling is a technique that employs a separate RM to score and guide the generation of responses, aiming to produce higher-quality outputs by selecting responses with higher rewards. Compared to using RM, the proposed method of scaling inference compute through `Maj@N`, and especially `WeightedMaj@N` offers a more direct approach without specifically retraining RMs from other LLMs. Additionally, the integration of small proxies for confidence labeling provides an efficient means to enhance the decision-making process without the overhead of maintaining a separate reward model.
